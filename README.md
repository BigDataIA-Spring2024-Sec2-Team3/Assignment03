# Assignment03

# Problem Statement

This repository encompasses the code and documentation for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the Assignment03. The project involves designing Python classes to represent schemas for CFA webpages and Grobid output, alongside data and schema validation using Pydantic 2 and the creation of "clean" CSV files. In Part 2, the integration of DBT (Data Build Tool) with Snowflake is introduced to run transformation workflows on the clean data generated in Part 1.

# Project Goals

Class Design and Validation:
Implement URLClass, MetaDataPDFClass, and ContentPDFClass.
Validate data using Pydantic 2 and create clean CSV files.

Testing: 
Develop 5+5 Pytest cases for validation scenarios.

DBT Integration and Schema:
Design and validate a Snowflake schema for Part 2.
Load clean data into Snowflake and create a summary table using DBT.

Modeling:
Create the DBT model and schema design.

Deployment and Environments:
Commit and deploy the DBT model.
Set up Test and Production environments in Snowflake with a focus on consistency and security.

# Data Sources

CFA Webpages:

Raw data for CFA webpages, consisting of 224 pages.
